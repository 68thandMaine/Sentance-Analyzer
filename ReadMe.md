## Description

This is a basic JavaScript app that utilizes Webpack and NPM to practice bundling files, importing/exporting constructors, and managing npm manifests.

A user will enter a Title, Date, and Entry for a blog. The app will return the number of words in the entry, the number of vowels in the entry, and the number of consonants in the entry.

### Next Steps

I would like to add more styling to this app and refactor the code.
